# RotOS

A small little operating system written by me for educational purposes.

You will need a cross-compiler for i386/i686 and an emulator (or real hardware perhaps) to run it.

## TODO

- [ ] Dockerize cross compiler & binutils
- [ ] Use proper linking methods
- [ ] Make the makefile print prettier
